<---------------Analysis-------------------------------------->
At times, malware might contain resources embeded in them.
To identify them, use pescanner and check in the Resource header, to identify the resource. In the Labs, Lab01-04 has a BIN resource.
I used Resource Hacker to extract the resource.Youtube for usage of Resource Hacker.
For the lab, click Action-->Save as Binary.
Analyze the new resource.
